# Summary

Just a quick tool for splitting a zip into arbitrarily sized smaller zip files for use with some web portals with file size limits

Assumes a level of incompetency (TUI rather than passing CLI args) bc this isn't for my own use but I'll probably add support for invokation with command line args when I can be bothered bc lowkey might be a useful tool for personal use on the home server
